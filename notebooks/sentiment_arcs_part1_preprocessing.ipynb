Virtually all long text contains narrative elements...(TODO: Insert excerpts from Paper Abstract/Intro Sections here)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **SentimentArcs: Cloning the Github repository to your gDrive**\n","\n","If this is the first time using SentimentArcs, you will need to copy the software from our Github.com repository (github repo). The default recommended gDrive path is ./gdrive/MyDrive/research/sentiment_arcs/'. \n","\n","The first time you run this notebook and connect your Google gDrive, it will allow to to specify the path to your SentimentArcs subdirectory. If it does not exists, this notebook will copy/clone the SentimentArcs github repository code to your gDrive at the path you specify.\n","\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **NovelText: A Reference Corpus of 24 Diverse Novel**\n","\n","Sentiment Arcs comes with a carefully curated reference corpus of Novels to illustrate the unique diachronic sentiment analysis characteristic of long form fictional narrativeas. This corpus of 24 diverse novels also provides a baseline for exploring and comparing new novels with sentiment analysis using SentimentArcs.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Preparing New Novels: Formatting and adding to subdirectory**\n","\n","To analyze new novels with SentimentArcs, the body of the text should consist of plain text organized in to blocks separated by two newlines which visually look like a single blank line between blocks. These blocks are usually paragraphs but can also include title headers, separate lines of dialog or quotes. Please reference any of the 24 novels in the NovelText corpus for examples of this expected format.\n","\n","Once the new novel is correctly formatted as a plain text file, it should follow this standard file naming convention:\n","\n","[first letter of first name]+[full lastname]_[abbreviated book title].txt\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","* fdouglass_narrativelifeofaslave\n","* fscottfitzgerald_thegreatgatsby.txt\n","* vwoolf_mrsdalloway.txt\n","* homer-ewilson_odyssey.txt (trans. E.Wilson)\n","* mproust-mtreharne_3guermantesway.txt (Book 3, trans. M.Treharne)\n","* staugustine_confessions9end.txt (Upto and incl Book 9)\n","\n","Note the optional author suffix (-translator) and optional title suffix (-selected chapters/books)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Adding New Novels: Add file to subdirectory and Update this Notebook**\n","\n","Once you have a cleaned and text file named according the standard rule above, you must move that file to the subdirectory of all input novels and update the global variable in this notebook that defines which novels to analyze.\n","\n","First, copy your cleaned text file to the subdirectory containing all novels read by this notebook. This subdir is defined by the program variable 'subdir_novels' with the default value './in1_novels/'\n","\n","Second, update the program variable 'novels_dt'. This is a Dictionary data structure that following the pattern below:\n","```\n","novels_dt = {\n","  'cdickens_achristmascarol':['A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ',1843,1399],\n","```\n","Where the first string (the dictionary key) must match the filename root without the '.txt' suffix (e.g. cdickens_achristmascarol). The Dictionary value after the ':' is a list of three elements:\n","\n","* A nicely formatted string of the form '(title) by (full first and last name of author)' that should be a human friendly string used to label plots and saved files.\n","\n","* The (publication year) and the (sentence count). Both are optional, but should have placeholder string '0' if unknown. These are intended for future reference and analytics.\n","\n","* Your future self will thank you if you insert new novels into the 'novels_dt' in alphabetic order for faster and more accurate reference.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **How to Execute SentimentArcs Notebooks:**\n","\n","This is a Jupyter Notebook created to run on Google's free Colab service using only a browers and your exiting Google email account. We chose Google Colab because it is relatively, fast, free, easy to use and makes collaboration as simple as web browsing.\n","\n","A few reminders about using Jupyter Notebooks general and SentimentArcs in particular:\n","\n","* All cells must be run ***in order*** as later code cells often depend upon the output of earlier code cells\n","\n","* ***Cells that take more time to execute*** (> 1 min) usually begin with *%%time* which outputs the *total execution time* of the last run.  This timing output is deleted and recalculated each time the code cell is executed.\n","\n","* **[OPTIONAL]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* change a setting in that cell to customize behavior.\n","\n","* **[CUSTOMIZE]** at the top of a cell indicates you *must* change a setting in that cell.\n","\n","* **[RESTART REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* see a *[RESTART REQUIRED] button* at the end of the output. *If you see this button, you must select [Runtime]->[Restart Runtime] from the top menubar.\n","\n","* **[INPUT REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you will be required to take some action for execution to proceed, usually by clicking a button or entering the response to a prompt.\n","\n","All cells with a top comment prefixed with # [OPTIONAL]: indicates that you can change a setting to customize behavior, the prefix [CUSTOMIZE] indicates you MUST set/change a setting\n","\n","* SentimentArcs divides workflow into a series of chronological Jupyter Notebooks that must be run in order. Here is an overview of the workflow:\n","\n","***\n","\n","**SentimentArcs Notebooks Workflow**\n","1. Notebook #1: Preprocess Text\n","2. Notebook #2: Compute Sentiment Values (Simple Models/CPUs)\n","3. Notebook #3: Compute Sentiment Values (Complex Models/GPUs)\n","4. Notebook #4: Combine all Sentiment Values, perform Time Series analysis, and extract Crux points and surrounding text\n","\n","If you are unfamilar with setting up and using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks, here are a series of resources to quickly bring you up to speed. If you are using SentimentArcs with the Cambridge University Press Elements textbook, there are also a series of videos by Prof Elkins and Chun stepping you through these
